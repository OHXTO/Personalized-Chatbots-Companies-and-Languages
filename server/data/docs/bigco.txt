Why should the students apply to work with your team, and what will they learn about working at a BigCo?

Cornell Tech students should join our team if they want to work on real problems that affect real patients, every single day. Catholic Health is a large health system with six hospitals and a vast network of outpatient sites—meaning the scale, data, and operational challenges are incredibly rich for students interested in healthcare innovation.

Students joining our team will gain a unique, high-impact, real-world experience inside a major health system actively transforming quality, safety, and operational performance. They will:

Learn how hospitals apply predictive analytics, improvement science, and AI to drive measurable outcomes.
Work directly with clinical leaders, data scientists, operational executives, and front-line teams.
Participate in meaningful projects in throughput, capacity management, readmission reduction, and systemwide performance improvement.
Gain exposure to strategic program development, regulatory strategy, business development, and system-level decision-making.
Build skills in systems thinking, project management, quality analytics, policy interpretation, and change leadership.
See how senior-level decisions translate into safer care for thousands of patients every day.
Our team is collaborative, mission-driven, and focused on innovation — an ideal environment for students interested in healthcare management, data science, quality improvement, or health policy.
